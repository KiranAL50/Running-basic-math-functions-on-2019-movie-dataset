# Running-basic-math-functions-on-2019-movie-dataset
Pandas is a powerful Python package that can be used to perform statistical analysis. We will use pandas to calculate stats from an imported CSV file. We are going to use a movie dataset for this program. You can find the movie dataset here https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2019/

1. We will use math functions like mean, sum, avg on this dataset to better understand this dataset.
2. Then, we will use groupby to get more info on the distributors.
3. Finally, we will plot a bar graph to visualize this data.
